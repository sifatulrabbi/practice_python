    Hello my fellow {plural_noun_1} in 2020, it's me, George Washington, the first {occupation}.
    I am writing from the {place_1}, where I have been secretly living for the past {number} years.
    I am concerned by the {adjective_1} state of affairs in America these days. It seems that your
    politicians are more concerned with {verb_with_ing_1} one another than with listening to
    the {plural_noun_2} of the people. When we declared our independence from the {place_2}, we set
    forth on a/an {adjective_2} path guided by the voices of the everyday {plural_noun_3}. If we're
    going to keep {verb_with_ing_2}, then we need to learn how to respect all {plural_noun_4}.
    Don't get me wrong; we had {adjective_3} problems in my day, too. Benjamin Franklin once called
    me a/an {noun} and kicked me in the {body_part_1}. But at the end of the day, we were able
    to {verb} in harmony. Let us find that {adjective_4} spirit once again, or lese I'm taking my
    {body_part_2} off the quarter!
